# Guac-A-Mole-Project-1
Guac-a-mole is a type of game where you collect as much as "Mole" as possible within 10 seconds.)

1. As a user i want to be able to see the tile of the game and the main game station -the grid box- where i will be collecting the moles.
2. i also want to see "start-game" button to start the game.
3. when i hit the button, i want to see the moles moving and i have to be able to click at the moles.
4. while i am clicking and collecting moles i want to see a timer at the top counting from 10 to 1.
5. once the time is over, i want the moving mole to stop at where it is and i want to get an alert message telling me how many moles i have collected within ten mins.
6. after i see the alert message i have to be able to click ok to let the game know that i have read it and want to restart again.
7. after i click ok but NOT start - YET, i want the moles to stop at where it is and still show me "your score: 'howevermuch i have collected' " and "Time left: 0".
8. once i hit start again, i want to start the moles moving letting me clicking them, the timer counting down form 10 to 1, and showing me the new score at the alert console.
